# CS50-Finance
A website that allows users to "buy" and "sell" stocks using fake money

It was built while progressing through Harvard's online course CS50
It was built using the LAMP stack. 

The majority of the code and features I wrote are in public and views folders.
The rest was provided to me by the CS50 curriculum
