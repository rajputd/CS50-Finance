# CS50-Finance
A website that allows users to "buy" and "sell" stocks using fake money

It was built while progressing through Harvard's online course CS50
It was built using the LAMP stack. 

The majority of the code and features I contributed to this project can be seen in the following files:

register.php      // allowed new users to register accounts
quote.php         // allowed users to get real time stock using Yahoo! Finance
portfolio.php     // allowed users to view any stock they owned and see the total value of their portfolio
index.php         // works with portfolio.php to display user's portfolio
sell.php          // allowed users to sell any stock in their portfolio using real time prices
buy.php           // allowed users to buy any stock in the market using real time prices
history.php       // allowed users to see a history of their financial transactions
password.php      // allowed users to change their passwords
deposit.php      // allowed users to add money to their accounts
