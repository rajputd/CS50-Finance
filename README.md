# CS50-Finance
A website that allows users to "buy" and "sell" stocks using fake money

It was built while progressing through Harvard's online course CS50
It was built using the LAMP stack. 

The majority of the code and features I contributed to this project can be seen in the following files:

register.php      
quote.php         
portfolio.php     
index.php         
sell.php          
buy.php           
history.php       
password.php      
deposit.php
